    <h2>Punjab's Dish saag</h2>
    <p>Saag is a traditional North Indian dish made from leafy greens like mustard leaves, spinach, fenugreek, or bathua. The greens are cooked, mashed, and flavored with onions, garlic, ginger, green chilies, and spices. Sometimes maize flour is added for a smooth texture.

The most famous version is Sarson da Saag, usually served with Makki di Roti and topped with butter or ghee, making it a beloved Punjabi winter delicacy. Saag is not only tasty but also rich in vitamins, minerals, and iron, making it very healthy.</p>
